# Webhooks

Our webhooks feature allows a URL, supplied by you, to receive HTTP POST
requests corresponding to events related to your vote(s). For example, when
individual votes are recorded.

The URL is configured through the Electionbuddy website, if enabled on your
account. To enable webhooks contact an Electionbuddy customer support
representative.

Once enabled, individual webhooks can be enabled for all elections, or enabled or disabled
on an election-by-election basis, in the organization settings.

If enabled on an election-by-election basis, the webhooks can be configured on
the voter list section fo the vote setup.

## Payload Overview

The HTTP POST requests will contain a JSON payload. The payload contains
information about your vote, the organization associated with that vote,
and the current status of the vote. The parts of the payload will be
different depending on your vote configuration.
